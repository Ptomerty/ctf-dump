# Multilingual and Multidigital

Why was this made? 

We're told to treat `top gun` as Korean. Doing some [recon on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language_and_computers#Hangul_in_Unicode), we find that the Korean Unicode block is defined as `[(initial) × 588 + (medial) × 28 + (final)] + 44032`. We are also told that the number line starts at 0, so taking A=0, B=1, and so on, we can calculate the Unicode equivalent of `top gun`.
